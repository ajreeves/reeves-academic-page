abstract: "Assessment of the nation’s economic performance has been repeatedly
linked to voters’ decision-making in U.S. presidential elections. Here we inquire as
to where those economic evaluations originate. One possibility in the politicized
environment of a major campaign is that they are partisan determinations and do not
reflect actual economic circumstances. Another possibility is that these judgments
arise from close attention to news media, which is presumably highlighting national
economic conditions as a facet of campaign coverage. Still a third explanation is
that voters derive their national economic evaluations from living out their lives in
particular localities which may or may not be experiencing the conditions that affect
the nation as a whole. Drawing upon data from the 2008 presidential election, we
find that varying local conditions do shape the economic evaluations of political
independents. Moreover, unemployment is not the only salient factor, as fuel prices
and foreclosures also figured prominently. Local economic factors, what we call
geotropic considerations, shape national economic evaluations especially for those
who aren’t making these judgments on simple partisan grounds."
